Heir to the galactic throne, he was descended from kings and queens and led a life of luxury. However, he thirsted for something more. One day while on a space cruise, Tim took an escape pod down to a nearby planet to explore. While there he encountered a group of hostile aliens. Barely able to escape with his life, he became hopelessly lost and thus began a new adventure, trying to survive on his new home planet. In the meantime, elsewhere in the universe, Voldemort had secretly begun his campaign of terror, claiming dominion over all peaceful planets in his wake. Tim rallied all the people of his new world to defeat this terrible threat. But Voldemort had other plans, and attacked. The battle was long and harrowing, but Tim's people had endured much and were strong. Victorious, his name was recorded in the galactic lexicon and celebrated for generations to come. The end."

Before you plant hydrangeas, find an area in your yard that gets a mix of sun and shade and that has rich, porous soil. Youäó»ll also want to leave enough space for the bushes since they can grow to 4 feet by 4 feet. In the spring, dig a hole as deep as the root ball and 2-3 times as wide, and, once the bush is in place, fill the hole halfway with soil. After you water the hole and allow it to drain for 15 minutes, fill the rest of the hole with soil. Say äóìREAD STEPSäó, if you want me to read each step in detail."

You adorn the rocky side of an otherwise, sandy beach. You see the ocean waves coming in ceaselessly People are moving about the area, eating, and chatting. Day turns to night, the temperature cools. And then it is bright again and the temperature is warm You see a group of young men and women playing volleyball Day turns to night, and it gets colder And it is morning again A child, wandering away from his family nearby, gazes in amazement at your size and at your stillness You start to notice the days are getting shorter, and the nights longer. The wind begins to whistle constantly, and you get used to it Footprints in the sand have long since been washed away by water and wind. Soon, you notice that the sun is shining longer. A group of people comes onto the beach. And then there are more groups. Now you see people moving about the area, eating, and chatting again. In fact, a year has passed, and here you are, unmoving, solid, in the face of change. You are steady Now, to conclude, focus on the sensation of hearing this Temple Bell."
