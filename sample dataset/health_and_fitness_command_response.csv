Migraine treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks. Drug therapy, biofeedback training, stress reduction, and elimination of certain foods from the diet are the most common methods of preventing and controlling migraine and other vascular headaches. The first step in caring for a tension-type headache involves treating any specific disorder or disease that may be causing it. A physician may suggest using analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or antidepressants to treat a tension-type headache that's not associated with a disease. Treatment options for cluster headaches include triptan drugs, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, and oxygen therapy."

Virtual Nurse,"""Tell me about Warfarin side effects""","Warfarin also sold under the brand names of Coumadin, is the main oral anticoagulant used in the UK. Oral means it's taken by mouth. An anticoagulant is a medicine that stops blood clotting. Clotting (thickening) is a complex process involving a number of substances called clotting factors. Clotting factors are produced by the liver and help control bleeding. They work with cells that trigger the clotting process (platelets) to ensure blood clots effectively. To produce some of the clotting factors, the liver needs a good supply of vitamin K. Warfarin blocks one of the enzymes (proteins) that uses vitamin K in order to produce clotting factors. This disrupts the clotting process, making it take longer for the blood to clot. Anticoagulant medicines, such as warfarin, are often prescribed for people who've had a condition caused by a blood clot, such as: a stroke, a heart attack, deep vein thrombosis ‰ÛÒ a blood clot within a deep vein in the body, usually in a leg. And Pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lungs. Warfarin may also be prescribed for people at an increased risk of developing harmful blood clots, such as those with: a replacement or mechanical (prosthetic) heart valve, an irregular heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation, a blood clotting disorder, such as thrombophilia and people with an increased risk of blood clots following surgery. It's very important that you take warfarin exactly as directed. Don't increase your prescribed dose unless the doctor in charge of your care advises you to. Warfarin is taken once a day, usually in the evening. It's important to take your dose at the same time each day, before, during or after a meal. The aim of warfarin therapy is to decrease the blood's tendency to clot, but not stop it clotting completely. This means the dose of warfarin you're taking must be carefully monitored and, if necessary, adjusted. You'll have regular blood tests at your GP surgery or local anticoagulant clinic to make sure your dose is correct. The international normalised ratio (INR) is a measure of how long it takes your blood to clot. The longer it takes your blood to clot, the higher your INR. Your INR will be used to determine the dose of warfarin you need to take. Although there are now three new anticoagulants that don't require regular monitoring ‰ÛÒ rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran. Most people who need an anticoagulant will be prescribed warfarin. When you start taking warfarin, you may be given a yellow booklet about anticoagulants, which explains your treatment. How long you'll need to take warfarin for will depend on the condition for which it's been prescribed. Ask the healthcare professional responsible for your care if you're not sure. Bleeding is the main side effect associated with warfarin, as it slows down the blood's normal clotting ability. You're at greatest risk of bleeding in the first few weeks of starting treatment with warfarin and when you're unwell. You should therefore seek medical attention if you: pass blood in your urine or faeces, pass black faeces, have severe bruising, have long nosebleeds ‰ÛÒ lasting more than 10 minutes, have bleeding gums, cough up blood or have blood in your vomit, experience unusual headaches or if you have heavy or increased bleeding during your period, or any other bleeding from your vagina (in women). Warfarin can interact with many other medicines. The patient information leaflet that comes with a medicine should tell you if it's safe to take with warfarin. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure. When taking warfarin: don't take aspirin, or treatments containing aspirin, unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional as it could cause bleeding. Don't take ibuprofen unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional. You can take paracetamol, but don't take more than the recommended dose. Herbal medicines and supplements can also interact with warfarin. You should therefore avoid taking them without first checking with"

Generally that means a thermometer reading over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38 Celsius. Fever is often a sign of an infection. A fever by itself is usually harmless but can be uncomfortable. Symptoms include muscle aches, mild headaches, less appetite, and less energy. Children with a fever may not look or act sick. Babies are often fussy when they have a fever. An infant under three months old who has a fever needs to be seen by a doctor immediately. Also get urgent care if your child has a fever with no sweating, a severe headache, seizures, a stiff neck, or confusion. If your child has a fever with repeated vomiting or diarrhea, significant discomfort, or any other worrisome or unusual symptoms, get immediate care.

Migraine treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks. Drug therapy, biofeedback training, stress reduction, and elimination of certain foods from the diet are the most common methods of preventing and controlling migraine and other vascular headaches. The first step in caring for a tension-type headache involves treating any specific disorder or disease that may be causing it. A physician may suggest using analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or antidepressants to treat a tension-type headache that's not associated with a disease. Treatment options for cluster headaches include triptan drugs, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, and oxygen therapy."

Fitness Motivation Quote,"""Alexa, Tell fit coach to give me a motivation quote""","Here's a The Motivation, the movie, quote: ""After a while the sponsors were like, ""hey well where's Nyjah? You know, like he used to be in the magazines almost every month and now we never see him anymore and we're paying him all this money and he's not around."" That was the first time in my relationship with their dad where I spoke up and I felt like Adeyemi was putting his opinions in front of what was best for Nyjah. It's just about control. Eventually, Element said, ""you know, we've got to let it go. We cannot continue to pay this kid because it's a completely unmanageable relationship.""""."

Slow Carb Checker,"""Alexa, ask Slow Carb Checker, can I eat apples?""","The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day."
