Super Creature Showdown,help,"Welcome to the super cook kitchen assistant. I can help you find thousands of recipes you can make right now, using just the ingredients you have at home. Just like a human chef, I need to know what ingredients you have, before I can start suggesting ideas. The more I know about the ingredients in your kichen, the better I'll be at recommending dishes you can make. The only ingredients I assume you have, are, water, salt, and pepper. You'll need to let me know about all the rest. Adding ingredients is easy. For example, to add eggs,tomato and olive oil, just say, "" add eggs, tomato and olive oil to my kitchen"" To remove ingredients, just say something like, "" remove tomato and eggs from my kitchen"", or, "" i ran out of milk and butter"" You can also tell me to remove all of your ingredients, by saying, ""remove all of my ingredients"" Not sure if you've added certain ingredients? You can ask me by saying something like, "" do i have spinach and lemon in my kitchen?"". You can also ask me, ""what vegetables are in my kitchen?"", or, ""what dairy ingredients are in my kitchen?"", etc. Make sure to let me know about new ingredients you purchase, and ingredients you run out of. When you add ingredients, I'll find more dishes you can make, when you remove ingredients, there will be fewer recipes you can make. To find out what recipes you can make, just ask, ""what can i make?"" If you want to find dishes that use certain ingredients, you can ask me by saying something like, "" what can i make with my spinach and onion?"" If you want to make something for dinner, or breakfast, just say, "" what can i make for breakfast"", or, "" what can i make for dinner"". You can also ask more advanced questions like, ""what can i make for dinner using my chicken breast and lemon"", or, ""what breakfast recipes can i make with peanut butter"". I can also help you find recipes used in certain meal types and cuisines, simply ask me, """"what mexican recipes can i make"", or, ""what Mediterranean recipes can i make"", or, ""what dessert recipes can i make"". You can get more detailed by asking things like, ""what can i make for dessert using my apple and cinnamon"" If you have a certan dish in mind, and you're curious if you have everything you need to make it, you can ask me by saying something like, "" can I make fettucine alfredo?"", or, ""can i make sesame chicken?"". If you don't have all the ingredients needed to make the dish, I'll let you know exactly what you're missing. I know how to make over half a million dishes, so you can ask me about any dish imaginable. After you choose a recipe from one of the options I give you, I'll send detailed instructions about the recipe to your Alexa App. Are you curious what goes into certain dishes? I can help you with that too. You can ask me by saying something like, "" what goes into shrimp scampi?"", or, ""what goes into spicy recipes?"" Ready to get started? What can I do for you?"
