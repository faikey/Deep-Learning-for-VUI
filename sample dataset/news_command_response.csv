On April 9th William Barr, America's attorney-general, vowed to release a redacted version of Robert Mueller's report into links between Russia and Donald Trump's campaign within a week. That deadline expired today, with Mr Barr now saying he needs until Thursday. In the interim, the two parties are spinning feverishly. Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader in the Senate, said he doubts Mr Barr will be fair and dispassionate in his redactions; the House Judiciary Committee authorised its chairman to subpoena the complete report. Mr Trump, who previously supported the release of the entire report, has more recently called Mr Mueller's investigation a treasonous hoax and groused that the Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything. Washington's attention will focus most on what the report says about obstruction of justice. Mr Barr's summary said the report gave no grounds to pursue charges against Mr Trump, but it could still contain enough to embarrass him. You can hear the next article or the available sections.
