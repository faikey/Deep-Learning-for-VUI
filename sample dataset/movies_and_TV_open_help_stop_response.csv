Riffing off the cliched Hollywood practice of appalling overdubbing of kung fu movies, Kai En Tai would excitedly cut promos to a dead mic, while a deep, out-of-synch American voice would boom over the PA with the English dub of the promo. Inevitably, Taka would end with the word EEEEVIL!, and Funaki would tack INDEEEED! on the end. A rarity for WWE comedy gimmicks, the bit was actually funny. Perhaps that‰Ûªs because Shane McMahon came up with it rather than his father. What few people realised was that the hilariously over-the-top dubbed voice was Shane as well. Eeeevil indeeeed."
