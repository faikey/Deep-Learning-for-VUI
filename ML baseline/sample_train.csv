"A cat's meow can be assertive, plaintive, friendly, bold, welcoming, attention soliciting, demanding, or complaining. It can even be silent, where the cat opens its mouth but does not vocalize. Adult cats do not meow to each other, and so adult meowing to human beings is likely to be a post-domestication extension of mewing by kittens.

Do you want to open it? Welcome to The Economist Espresso. I can tell you TodayÛªs agenda, the World in Brief or Quote of the Day. How can I help you? Okay! The World in Brief: The first poll published including the new Brexit Party found that Nigel Farage's anti-EU vehicle would come tops in May's European Parliament elections. Britain must take part in the balloting because of delays to Brexit. Voters, who pay little attention to the Strasbourg-based parliament's work, tend to cast protest votes amid low turnout. North Korea claimed it had fired a new tactical guided weapon, the first missile test since a failed summit in Hanoi between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and Donald Trump in February. A short-range cruise or anti-tank missile, analysts reckon, would inject a high-tech element into the country's huge but backward armed forces. A long-range test would cross an American red line. Unofficial quick counts showed that Joko Widodo, Indonesia's president, is likely to have won re-election on Wednesday, over Prabowo Subianto, whom he defeated in 2014. Jokowi, as he is known, had led comfortably in the polls. Official results will be announced in May. Alan GarcÌ_a, a former president of Peru, died after shooting himself in the head to avoid arrest in connection with one of the biggest corruption scandals in Latin American history. Elected president twice, in 1985 and 2006, Mr GarcÌ_a was one of nine people a judge had ordered arrested for alleged involvement in bribes distributed by Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company. Dozens of medical professionals across seven American states were charged with illegally prescribing addictive pain pills. The charges were the result of work by a team of federal investigators created last year to target the Appalachian region, which has been hit particularly hard by the opioid epidemic. The Justice Department called it the largest prescription opioid enforcement effort ever undertaken. The European Union published a list of $20bn-worth of American exports to target with tariffs. Last week the Trump administration released its own list of European goods to hit with levies. The spat stems from a 14-year-old dispute over subsidies given to rival aerospace firms Boeing and Airbus. On Monday EU countries voted to start formal trade talks with America. Huawei's chief executive promised German officials a no-spy agreement as part of its effort to be considered for contracts to build the country's 5G wireless networks. The comments, reported in Wirtschaftswoche, a magazine, are striking as the Chinese telecoms-equipment-maker has said it does not do the bidding of the Chinese state, or install back doors for spies to exploit.

To add ingredients, say something like, add butter and lemon to my kitchen. What can i do for you? Welcome to the super cook kitchen assistant. I can help you find thousands of recipes you can make right now, using just the ingredients you have at home. Just like a human chef, I need to know what ingredients you have, before I can start suggesting ideas. The more I know about the ingredients in your kichen, the better I'll be at recommending dishes you can make. The only ingredients I assume you have, are, water, salt, and pepper. You'll need to let me know about all the rest. Adding ingredients is easy. For example, to add eggs,tomato and olive oil, just say, "" add eggs, tomato and olive oil to my kitchen"" To remove ingredients, just say something like, "" remove tomato and eggs from my kitchen"", or, "" i ran out of milk and butter"" You can also tell me to remove all of your ingredients, by saying, ""remove all of my ingredients"" Not sure if you've added certain ingredients? You can ask me by saying something like, "" do i have spinach and lemon in my kitchen?"". You can also ask me, ""what vegetables are in my kitchen?"", or, ""what dairy ingredients are in my kitchen?"", etc. Make sure to let me know about new ingredients you purchase, and ingredients you run out of. When you add ingredients, I'll find more dishes you can make, when you remove ingredients, there will be fewer recipes you can make. To find out what recipes you can make, just ask, ""what can i make?"" If you want to find dishes that use certain ingredients, you can ask me by saying something like, "" what can i make with my spinach and onion?"" If you want to make something for dinner, or breakfast, just say, "" what can i make for breakfast"", or, "" what can i make for dinner"". You can also ask more advanced questions like, ""what can i make for dinner using my chicken breast and lemon"", or, ""what breakfast recipes can i make with peanut butter"". I can also help you find recipes used in certain meal types and cuisines, simply ask me, """"what mexican recipes can i make"", or, ""what Mediterranean recipes can i make"", or, ""what dessert recipes can i make"". You can get more detailed by asking things like, ""what can i make for dessert using my apple and cinnamon"" If you have a certan dish in mind, and you're curious if you have everything you need to make it, you can ask me by saying something like, "" can I make fettucine alfredo?"", or, ""can i make sesame chicken?"". If you don't have all the ingredients needed to make the dish, I'll let you know exactly what you're missing. I know how to make over half a million dishes, so you can ask me about any dish imaginable. After you choose a recipe from one of the options I give you, I'll send detailed instructions about the recipe to your Alexa App. Are you curious what goes into certain dishes? I can help you with that too. You can ask me by saying something like, "" what goes into shrimp scampi?"", or, ""what goes into spicy recipes?"" Ready to get started? What can I do for you? bye",3

Warfarin also sold under the brand names of Coumadin, is the main oral anticoagulant used in the UK. Oral means it's taken by mouth. An anticoagulant is a medicine that stops blood clotting. Clotting (thickening) is a complex process involving a number of substances called clotting factors. Clotting factors are produced by the liver and help control bleeding. They work with cells that trigger the clotting process (platelets) to ensure blood clots effectively. To produce some of the clotting factors, the liver needs a good supply of vitamin K. Warfarin blocks one of the enzymes (proteins) that uses vitamin K in order to produce clotting factors. This disrupts the clotting process, making it take longer for the blood to clot. Anticoagulant medicines, such as warfarin, are often prescribed for people who've had a condition caused by a blood clot, such as: a stroke, a heart attack, deep vein thrombosis äóñ a blood clot within a deep vein in the body, usually in a leg. And Pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lungs. Warfarin may also be prescribed for people at an increased risk of developing harmful blood clots, such as those with: a replacement or mechanical (prosthetic) heart valve, an irregular heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation, a blood clotting disorder, such as thrombophilia and people with an increased risk of blood clots following surgery. It's very important that you take warfarin exactly as directed. Don't increase your prescribed dose unless the doctor in charge of your care advises you to. Warfarin is taken once a day, usually in the evening. It's important to take your dose at the same time each day, before, during or after a meal. The aim of warfarin therapy is to decrease the blood's tendency to clot, but not stop it clotting completely. This means the dose of warfarin you're taking must be carefully monitored and, if necessary, adjusted. You'll have regular blood tests at your GP surgery or local anticoagulant clinic to make sure your dose is correct. The international normalised ratio (INR) is a measure of how long it takes your blood to clot. The longer it takes your blood to clot, the higher your INR. Your INR will be used to determine the dose of warfarin you need to take. Although there are now three new anticoagulants that don't require regular monitoring äóñ rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran. Most people who need an anticoagulant will be prescribed warfarin. When you start taking warfarin, you may be given a yellow booklet about anticoagulants, which explains your treatment. How long you'll need to take warfarin for will depend on the condition for which it's been prescribed. Ask the healthcare professional responsible for your care if you're not sure. Bleeding is the main side effect associated with warfarin, as it slows down the blood's normal clotting ability. You're at greatest risk of bleeding in the first few weeks of starting treatment with warfarin and when you're unwell. You should therefore seek medical attention if you: pass blood in your urine or faeces, pass black faeces, have severe bruising, have long nosebleeds äóñ lasting more than 10 minutes, have bleeding gums, cough up blood or have blood in your vomit, experience unusual headaches or if you have heavy or increased bleeding during your period, or any other bleeding from your vagina (in women). Warfarin can interact with many other medicines. The patient information leaflet that comes with a medicine should tell you if it's safe to take with warfarin. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure. When taking warfarin: don't take aspirin, or treatments containing aspirin, unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional as it could cause bleeding. Don't take ibuprofen unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional. You can take paracetamol, but don't take more than the recommended dose. Herbal medicines and supplements can also interact with warfarin. You should therefore avoid taking them without first checking with Let's get started!

"This might answer your question: According to the NIH: Different types of headaches are treated differently. Migraine treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks. Drug therapy, biofeedback training, stress reduction, and elimination of certain foods from the diet are the most common methods of preventing and controlling migraine and other vascular headaches. The first step in caring for a tension-type headache involves treating any specific disorder or disease that may be causing it. A physician may suggest using analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or antidepressants to treat a tension-type headache that's not associated with a disease. Treatment options for cluster headaches include triptan drugs, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, and oxygen therapy. Sorry, I don't know that. This might answer your question: According to Mayo Clinic: There's no cure for the common cold. But rest, fluids, and over-the-counter treatments can help you feel a bit better. For a fever, sore throat, or headache, an over-the-counter pain reliever may help. But children and teens recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin.

"Here's your fact: Who won the Deadly Games tournament to crown a new WWF Champion at the 1998 Survivor Series? The Rock. The Rock defeated Mankind in the finals with some help from Vince McMahon. Here's your fact: Dwayne The Rock Johnson didnât develop the ability to quirk an eyebrow overnight while working the house show loop. No, the Peopleâs Eyebrow was something he came up with while studying criminology and physiology on a full football scholarship at the University Of Miami. Why he made it a thing back in college, I have no idea. Equally, I havenât got a clue why he decided to call it âthe Heat Browâ. Was it getting him heat? Did it make other people hot? Miamiâs a hot town. Was there perspiration involved? Weâll probably never know. He tried calling it that again when the eyebrow reappeared in the WWF, but it never caught on like âthe Peopleâs Eyebrowâ did. I couldn't find any songs matching unofficial w. w. e. superstars theme in your library . Here's your fact: Who did Chris Jericho interrupt when he made his WWE debut? The Rock. He interrupted The Rock on the Aug. 9, 1999, episode of Raw Is War. For Help, please visit the help pages on the Amazon web site. Here's your fact: In 2001, the WWFÛªs version of the Kai En Tai stable had been quietly dissolved when all of the villainous Orientals in the faction left the company, with the exception of Funaki and Taka Michinoku, who remained to form a comedic tag team under the same name. Riffing off the cliched Hollywood practice of appalling overdubbing of kung fu movies, Kai En Tai would excitedly cut promos to a dead mic, while a deep, out-of-synch American voice would boom over the PA with the English dub of the promo. Inevitably, Taka would end with the word EEEEVIL!, and Funaki would tack INDEEEED! on the end. A rarity for WWE comedy gimmicks, the bit was actually funny. Perhaps thatÛªs because Shane McMahon came up with it rather than his father. What few people realised was that the hilariously over-the-top dubbed voice was Shane as well. Eeeevil indeeeed.

"Did you know: Dung beetles existed at the same time as dinosaurs and they evolved to eat dinosaur poop. As dinosaurs began eating flowering plants they provided the first edible dung source for feeding. Fossilized dinosaur poop has evidence of tunneling associated with dung beetles as early as 70 to 80 million years ago. Did you know: Human poop is made up of about 75% water. The remaining 25% is a mix of gut bacteria, protein, fats, salts, and of course - some of whatever it is that you ate. Hmm, I'm not sure. Did you know: The Australian wombat has cube-shaped poop that it uses as a way to mark its territory and attract a mate. Wombats deposit their poop outside of their burrows and on top of rocks and logs on the edges of their territory where they are easily found by other wombats. The distinctive flat sides of the cubes have the benefit of keeping their poop from rolling off to a less visible spot. It wasn't me. For Help, please visit the help pages on the Amazon web site.",7

"Great! I love telling scary stories. Once upon a time, there was a boy named Xavier Stein. Xavier was determined to find the exact location where The Mad Scientist lived. After weeks of research, he set out one night to find it once and for all. With little effort, he hopped over the fence and found himself inside the abandoned fairgrounds. Darkness shrouded the scene as The Mad Scientist descended upon him. Though Xavier was able to narrowly avoid The Mad Scientist's clutches, he would be haunted forevermore by the chilling memory of the monster's breath on the back of his neck. The end. Ok, let's see, how about a funny story? Once upon a time, there was a boy named Oscar Harrison. he was being terrorized by his pet monkey, Hubert, when he realized time had gotten away from him. As Oscar stood up, he slipped on a banana peel left on the floor by Voldemort. Oscar opened his eyes hours later to a group of nurses standing over him in the emergency room chuckling. As Oscar looked around, he realized the banana peel was stuck to his head. Haha. The end. Great! I love telling sci-fi stories. Once upon a time, there was a girl named Annabelle Carroll. she was only a child when the aliens came for her. The monsters intended for her to work in the mines, but after only a short time in captivity she proved herself to be the prophesied one who would free them from oppression. she ascended to leadership and showed her new people how to fight. After many years she had a change of heart and decided to abandon the life she knew to join the Intergalactic Opera. Only in the Opera would she ever be able to realize her dreams.

The World in Brief: The first poll published including the new Brexit Party found that Nigel Farage's anti-EU vehicle would come tops in May's European Parliament elections. Britain must take part in the balloting because of delays to Brexit. Voters, who pay little attention to the Strasbourg-based parliament's work, tend to cast protest votes amid low turnout. North Korea claimed it had fired a new tactical guided weapon, the first missile test since a failed summit in Hanoi between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and Donald Trump in February. A short-range cruise or anti-tank missile, analysts reckon, would inject a high-tech element into the country's huge but backward armed forces. A long-range test would cross an American red line. Unofficial quick counts showed that Joko Widodo, Indonesia's president, is likely to have won re-election on Wednesday, over Prabowo Subianto, whom he defeated in 2014. Jokowi, as he is known, had led comfortably in the polls. Official results will be announced in May. Alan GarcÌ_a, a former president of Peru, died after shooting himself in the head to avoid arrest in connection with one of the biggest corruption scandals in Latin American history. Elected president twice, in 1985 and 2006, Mr GarcÌ_a was one of nine people a judge had ordered arrested for alleged involvement in bribes distributed by Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company. Dozens of medical professionals across seven American states were charged with illegally prescribing addictive pain pills. The charges were the result of work by a team of federal investigators created last year to target the Appalachian region, which has been hit particularly hard by the opioid epidemic. The Justice Department called it the largest prescription opioid enforcement effort ever undertaken. The European Union published a list of $20bn-worth of American exports to target with tariffs. Last week the Trump administration released its own list of European goods to hit with levies. The spat stems from a 14-year-old dispute over subsidies given to rival aerospace firms Boeing and Airbus. On Monday EU countries voted to start formal trade talks with America.

Welcome to the super cook kitchen assistant. I can help you find thousands of recipes you can make right now, using just the ingredients you have at home. Just like a human chef, I need to know what ingredients you have, before I can start suggesting ideas. The more I know about the ingredients in your kichen, the better I'll be at recommending dishes you can make. The only ingredients I assume you have, are, water, salt, and pepper. You'll need to let me know about all the rest. Adding ingredients is easy. For example, to add eggs,tomato and olive oil, just say, "" add eggs, tomato and olive oil to my kitchen"" To remove ingredients, just say something like, "" remove tomato and eggs from my kitchen"", or, "" i ran out of milk and butter"" You can also tell me to remove all of your ingredients, by saying, ""remove all of my ingredients"" Not sure if you've added certain ingredients? You can ask me by saying something like, "" do i have spinach and lemon in my kitchen?"". You can also ask me, ""what vegetables are in my kitchen?"", or, ""what dairy ingredients are in my kitchen?"", etc. Make sure to let me know about new ingredients you purchase, and ingredients you run out of. When you add ingredients, I'll find more dishes you can make, when you remove ingredients, there will be fewer recipes you can make. To find out what recipes you can make, just ask, ""what can i make?"" If you want to find dishes that use certain ingredients, you can ask me by saying something like, "" what can i make with my spinach and onion?"" If you want to make something for dinner, or breakfast, just say, "" what can i make for breakfast"", or, "" what can i make for dinner"". You can also ask more advanced questions like, ""what can i make for dinner using my chicken breast and lemon"", or, ""what breakfast recipes can i make with peanut butter"". I can also help you find recipes used in certain meal types and cuisines, simply ask me, """"what mexican recipes can i make"", or, ""what Mediterranean recipes can i make"", or, ""what dessert recipes can i make"". You can get more detailed by asking things like, ""what can i make for dessert using my apple and cinnamon"" If you have a certan dish in mind, and you're curious if you have everything you need to make it, you can ask me by saying something like, "" can I make fettucine alfredo?"", or, ""can i make sesame chicken?"". If you don't have all the ingredients needed to make the dish, I'll let you know exactly what you're missing. I know how to make over half a million dishes, so you can ask me about any dish imaginable. After you choose a recipe from one of the options I give you, I'll send detailed instructions about the recipe to your Alexa App. Are you curious what goes into certain dishes?

Warfarin also sold under the brand names of Coumadin, is the main oral anticoagulant used in the UK. Oral means it's taken by mouth. An anticoagulant is a medicine that stops blood clotting. Clotting (thickening) is a complex process involving a number of substances called clotting factors. Clotting factors are produced by the liver and help control bleeding. They work with cells that trigger the clotting process (platelets) to ensure blood clots effectively. To produce some of the clotting factors, the liver needs a good supply of vitamin K. Warfarin blocks one of the enzymes (proteins) that uses vitamin K in order to produce clotting factors. This disrupts the clotting process, making it take longer for the blood to clot. Anticoagulant medicines, such as warfarin, are often prescribed for people who've had a condition caused by a blood clot, such as: a stroke, a heart attack, deep vein thrombosis äóñ a blood clot within a deep vein in the body, usually in a leg. And Pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lungs. Warfarin may also be prescribed for people at an increased risk of developing harmful blood clots, such as those with: a replacement or mechanical (prosthetic) heart valve, an irregular heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation, a blood clotting disorder, such as thrombophilia and people with an increased risk of blood clots following surgery. It's very important that you take warfarin exactly as directed. Don't increase your prescribed dose unless the doctor in charge of your care advises you to. Warfarin is taken once a day, usually in the evening. It's important to take your dose at the same time each day, before, during or after a meal. The aim of warfarin therapy is to decrease the blood's tendency to clot, but not stop it clotting completely. This means the dose of warfarin you're taking must be carefully monitored and, if necessary, adjusted. You'll have regular blood tests at your GP surgery or local anticoagulant clinic to make sure your dose is correct. The international normalised ratio (INR) is a measure of how long it takes your blood to clot. The longer it takes your blood to clot, the higher your INR. Your INR will be used to determine the dose of warfarin you need to take. Although there are now three new anticoagulants that don't require regular monitoring äóñ rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran. Most people who need an anticoagulant will be prescribed warfarin. When you start taking warfarin, you may be given a yellow booklet about anticoagulants, which explains your treatment. How long you'll need to take warfarin for will depend on the condition for which it's been prescribed. Ask the healthcare professional responsible for your care if you're not sure. Bleeding is the main side effect associated with warfarin, as it slows down the blood's normal clotting ability. You're at greatest risk of bleeding in the first few weeks of starting treatment with warfarin and when you're unwell. You should therefore seek medical attention if you: pass blood in your urine or faeces, pass black faeces, have severe bruising, have long nosebleeds äóñ lasting more than 10 minutes, have bleeding gums, cough up blood or have blood in your vomit, experience unusual headaches or if you have heavy or increased bleeding during your period, or any other bleeding from your vagina (in women). Warfarin can interact with many other medicines. The patient information leaflet that comes with a medicine should tell you if it's safe to take with warfarin. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure. When taking warfarin: don't take aspirin, or treatments containing aspirin, unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional as it could cause bleeding. Don't take ibuprofen unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional. You can take paracetamol, but don't take more than the recommended dose. Herbal medicines and supplements can also interact with warfarin. You should therefore avoid taking them without first checking with Let's get started!

The first step in caring for a tension-type headache involves treating any specific disorder or disease that may be causing it. A physician may suggest using analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or antidepressants to treat a tension-type headache that's not associated with a disease.

"Great! I love telling scary stories. Once upon a time, there was a boy named Xavier Stein. Xavier was determined to find the exact location where The Mad Scientist lived. After weeks of research, he set out one night to find it once and for all. With little effort, he hopped over the fence and found himself inside the abandoned fairgrounds. Darkness shrouded the scene as The Mad Scientist descended upon him. Though Xavier was able to narrowly avoid The Mad Scientist's clutches, he would be haunted forevermore by the chilling memory of the monster's breath on the back of his neck. The end. Ok, let's see, how about a funny story? Once upon a time, there was a boy named Oscar Harrison. he was being terrorized by his pet monkey, Hubert, when he realized time had gotten away from him. As Oscar stood up, he slipped on a banana peel left on the floor by Voldemort. Oscar opened his eyes hours later to a group of nurses standing over him in the emergency room chuckling. As Oscar looked around, he realized the banana peel was stuck to his head. Haha. The end. Great! I love telling sci-fi stories. Once upon a time, there was a girl named Annabelle Carroll. she was only a child when the aliens came for her. The monsters intended for her to work in the mines, but after only a short time in captivity she proved herself to be the prophesied one who would free them from oppression. she ascended to leadership and showed her new people how to fight. After many years she had a change of heart and decided to abandon the life she knew to join the Intergalactic Opera. Only in the Opera would she ever be able to realize her dreams. So Annabelle hitched a ride on a space freighter to become a superstar. But The Mad Scientist had other plans, and attacked. The battle was long and harrowing, but Annabelle's people had endured much and were strong. Victorious, her name was recorded in the galactic lexicon and celebrated for generations to come. The end.",7

You have Supercook recipe finder enabled. Do you want to open it? Welcome back to super cook. I see you have no ingredients. To add ingredients, say something like, add butter and lemon to my kitchen. What can i do for you? Welcome to the super cook kitchen assistant. I can help you find thousands of recipes you can make right now, using just the ingredients you have at home. Just like a human chef, I need to know what ingredients you have, before I can start suggesting ideas. The more I know about the ingredients in your kichen, the better I'll be at recommending dishes you can make. The only ingredients I assume you have, are, water, salt, and pepper. You'll need to let me know about all the rest. Adding ingredients is easy. For example, to add eggs,tomato and olive oil, just say, "" add eggs, tomato and olive oil to my kitchen"" To remove ingredients, just say something like, "" remove tomato and eggs from my kitchen"", or, "" i ran out of milk and butter"" You can also tell me to remove all of your ingredients, by saying, ""remove all of my ingredients"" Not sure if you've added certain ingredients? You can ask me by saying something like, "" do i have spinach and lemon in my kitchen?"". You can also ask me, ""what vegetables are in my kitchen?"", or, ""what dairy ingredients are in my kitchen?"", etc. Make sure to let me know about new ingredients you purchase, and ingredients you run out of. When you add ingredients, I'll find more dishes you can make, when you remove ingredients, there will be fewer recipes you can make. To find out what recipes you can make, just ask, ""what can i make?"" If you want to find dishes that use certain ingredients, you can ask me by saying something like, "" what can i make with my spinach and onion?"" If you want to make something for dinner, or breakfast, just say, "" what can i make for breakfast"", or, "" what can i make for dinner"". You can also ask more advanced questions like, ""what can i make for dinner using my chicken breast and lemon"", or, ""what breakfast recipes can i make with peanut butter"". I can also help you find recipes used in certain meal types and cuisines, simply ask me, """"what mexican recipes can i make"", or, ""what Mediterranean recipes can i make"", or, ""what dessert recipes can i make"". You can get more detailed by asking things like, ""what can i make for dessert using my apple and cinnamon"" If you have a certan dish in mind, and you're curious if you have everything you need to make it, you can ask me by saying something like, "" can I make fettucine alfredo?"", or, ""can i make sesame chicken?"". If you don't have all the ingredients needed to make the dish, I'll let you know exactly what you're missing. I know how to make over half a million dishes, so you can ask me about any dish imaginable. After you choose a recipe from one of the options I give you, I'll send detailed instructions about the recipe to your Alexa App. Are you curious what goes into certain dishes? I can help you with that too. You can ask me by saying something like, "" what goes into shrimp scampi?"", or, ""what goes into spicy recipes?"" Ready to get started? What can I do for you? bye",2

The first step in caring for a tension-type headache involves treating any specific disorder or disease that may be causing it.
