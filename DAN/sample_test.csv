"This might answer your question: According to the NIH: Different types of headaches are treated differently. Migraine treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks. Drug therapy, biofeedback training, stress reduction, and elimination of certain foods from the diet are the most common methods of preventing and controlling migraine and other vascular headaches. The first step in caring for a tension-type headache involves treating any specific disorder or disease that may be causing it. A physician may suggest using analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or antidepressants to treat a tension-type headache that's not associated with a disease. Treatment options for cluster headaches include triptan drugs, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, and oxygen therapy. Sorry, I don't know that. This might answer your question: According to Mayo Clinic: There's no cure for the common cold. But rest, fluids, and over-the-counter treatments can help you feel a bit better. For a fever, sore throat, or headache, an over-the-counter pain reliever may help. But children and teens recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. If you have a stuffy nose, you can use decongestant nose drops or sprays for up to five days. Avoid using them for longer, and children under six shouldn't use them at all. For a cough, adults and children older than four can take cough medicine. There's no cure for the common cold. But rest, fluids, and over-the-counter treatments can help you feel a bit better.

This is Todayâs agenda: Mueller time: the report is overdue. On April 9th William Barr, America's attorney-general, vowed to release a redacted version of Robert Mueller's report into links between Russia and Donald Trump's campaign within a week. That deadline expired today, with Mr Barr now saying he needs until Thursday. In the interim, the two parties are spinning feverishly. Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader in the Senate, said he doubts Mr Barr will be fair and dispassionate in his redactions; the House Judiciary Committee authorised its chairman to subpoena the complete report. Mr Trump, who previously supported the release of the entire report, has more recently called Mr Mueller's investigation a treasonous hoax and groused that the Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything. Washington's attention will focus most on what the report says about obstruction of justice. Mr Barr's summary said the report gave no grounds to pursue charges against Mr Trump, but it could still contain enough to embarrass him. You can hear the next article or the available sections.

In developed countries, the average birth weight of a full-term newborn is approximately 3.4 kg, and is typically in the range of 2.7-4.6 kg. Over the first 5-7 days following birth, the body weight of a term neonate decreases by 3-7%, and is largely a result of the resorption and urination of the fluid that initially fills the lungs, in addition to a delay of often a few days before breastfeeding becomes effective.

This is Todayâs agenda: Mueller time: the report is overdue. On April 9th William Barr, America's attorney-general, vowed to release a redacted version of Robert Mueller's report into links between Russia and Donald Trump's campaign within a week. That deadline expired today, with Mr Barr now saying he needs until Thursday. In the interim, the two parties are spinning feverishly. Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader in the Senate, said he doubts Mr Barr will be fair and dispassionate in his redactions; the House Judiciary Committee authorised its chairman to subpoena the complete report. Mr Trump, who previously supported the release of the entire report, has more recently called Mr Mueller's investigation a treasonous hoax and groused that the Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything. Washington's attention will focus most on what the report says about obstruction of justice. Mr Barr's summary said the report gave no grounds to pursue charges against Mr Trump, but it could still contain enough to embarrass him. You can hear the next article or the available sections.

Ok, Here's Mayo Clinic First Aid A burn is tissue damage from scalding, flames , or another cause. Major burns need emergency help. A major burn is deep or large, and can make the skin dry and leathery. A major burn may look charred or have patches of white, brown, or black. Burns that cover the hands, feet, or face are considered major. So are burns on the buttocks, groin, and joints. A minor burn doesn't need emergency treatment.
